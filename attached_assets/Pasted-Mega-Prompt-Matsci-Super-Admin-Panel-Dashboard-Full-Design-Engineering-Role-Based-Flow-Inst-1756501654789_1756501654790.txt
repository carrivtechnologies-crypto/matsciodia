Mega Prompt — Matsci Super Admin Panel Dashboard (Full Design + Engineering + Role-Based Flow)

Instruction to AI Model:
Design and prototype a modern, fully connected, error-free, responsive super admin dashboard for the Matsci EdTech platform. The system must include role-based access control, deep UI flows for every entity (Course, Class, Test, Students, Sales, Campaigns), and ensure every action leads to a follow-up screen (confirmation, details page, analytics). Build it as a production-ready design + interactive prototype with scalable components and mock backend connections.
